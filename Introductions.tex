	\textbf{Fluid mechanics researcher, graduated from Xi’an Jiaotong University with a research focus on multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD), particularly interfacial flows and drop dynamics. Demonstrated expertise in the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method using the Basilisk open-source solver, with additional proficiency in OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, and COMSOL Multiphysics. Research work includes direct numerical simulations of compound drop impact, counter-jet formation, and transient force modeling. Experienced in simulation validation and collaborative scientific investigations across multidisciplinary domains.}
